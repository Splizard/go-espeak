go-espeak
=========

Go binding for Espeak

INSTALL:
--------

    go get github.com/Splizard/go-espeak

  Don't forget, that you need the Espeak-Development-Packages.
  
  On Ubuntu:
  
  	sudo apt-get install libespeak-dev

LICENSE:
--------

  The library is available under the same terms and conditions as Go, the BSD style license, and the LGPL (Lesser GNU Public License). The idea is that if you can use Go (and Espeak) in a project, you should also be able to use go-espeak.
