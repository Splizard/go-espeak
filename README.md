go-espeak
=========

Go binding for Espeak

INSTALL:
--------

  To experiment with go-espeak, you can just compile and run the example
  program:

    git clone  https://github.com/Splizard/go-espeak
    cd go-espeak
    make install
    make example
    ./example/helloworld/helloworld

  Or

    go get github.com/Splizard/go-espeak

  Don't forget, that you need the Espeak-Development-Packages.

LICENSE:
--------

  The library is available under the same terms and conditions as Go, the BSD style license, and the LGPL (Lesser GNU Public License). The idea is that if you can use Go (and Espeak) in a project, you should also be able to use go-espeak.
